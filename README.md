- Classifies patients into:
  - 🟢 Normal
  - 🟡 Hyperthyroid
  - 🔴 Hypothyroid
- Uses clinical and biochemical biomarkers
- Provides explainable predictions
- Compares multiple ML algorithms
- Produces publication-level evaluation visualizations

# 🧠 Explainability

SHAP is used to:

- Identify influential biomarkers
- Analyze feature contribution
- Improve clinical interpretability

Example interpretation:

> TSH and FTI show high contribution in differentiating hyperthyroid and hypothyroid cases.

This enhances transparency in clinical AI systems.
